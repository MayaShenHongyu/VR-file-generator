# Configurable VR File Generator Developer Manual

This is the developer manual for project: https://github.com/Rice-Perception-and-Action-Lab/MayaShen-configurable-VR-file-generator

If you're looking for the user manual: https://github.com/Rice-Perception-and-Action-Lab/MayaShen-configurable-VR-file-generator/blob/master/UserManual.md

### Purpose

This file generator generates input files for the VR experiment (WinObjVR) based on user specification. It also allows users to configure the format of the generated files. For instance, you could add a new option "pink" to the "feedbackColor" entry in the "config.JSON" file.

There are two kinds of files you can generate: configuration file and trial file.

-   Configuration file: `config.json`
    -   This file specifies the configuration for the overall experiment and the name of the trial file, which will have the details for all the trials within the experiment.
-   Trial file: `[trial name].json`
    -   This file contains the information for all of the trials in the experiment. It consists of a list of `trial`s. A `trial` is a trial number and a `scene`, which specifies the objects in the scene and their parameters such as velocity, start position, end position, etc.

## Status

#### What's been done

-   All feature requirements have been met.
-   Professor DeLucia and Miles did quick tests by running the program. The program correctly generated files based on their input to the forms.
-   Professor DeLucia and Miles gave feedback on the user manuals.

#### Problems and issues

-   Systematic testing has not been completed yet.

#### Next steps

-   Do more testing. In particular, we need to test if the programs configures the forms correctly given user specification.
-   Have more students read the user and developer manuals to identify any areas that need clarification.

### Languages, frameworks, and libraries

-   This project uses JavaScript and CSS.

### Files and programs needed

-   Git - Follow the instructions here to install: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git.
-   NPM (package manager for JavaScript language) - Follow the instructons here to install: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm. To confirm that you have successfully installed, open a terminal and run command `npm -v`. You should see a virsion number printed.
-   Your favorite IDE (Integrated development environment, or code editor) - The author used Visual Sudio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/download), but you could use any IDE you like.

### Set up

1. After you have installed Git and NPM, open a new terminal and go to the directory in which you would like to keep this project with. Use command `cd [directory name]` to change your working directory. For instance, if you want to keep this project on your desktop, you should run `cd Desktop`. 
2. Clone the project to local with this command: `git clone https://github.com/Rice-Perception-and-Action-Lab/MayaShen-configurable-VR-file-generator.git`. You will see a new folder with the name of this project on your desktop, for instance. You have successfully cloned this project to local.
3. Go to the directory you just pulled from git with command `cd MayaShen-configurable-VR-file-generator` and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Use your IDE to open this project. For Visual Studio Code, you should do `Open Folder -> Select MayaShen-configurable-VR-file-generator folder`.  You can start coding now.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory (folder MayaShen-configurable-VR-file-generator) in terminal, you can run the followings:

#### `npm run start`

Run the app in the development mode. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Build the app for production (output executables) to the `dist` folder.<br />

#### `npx prettier --write .`

Format all files with Prettier. Prettier is a code formatting tool. See docs: https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html

    -   `Home.js` is the home page of the app.
    - Directory `config_file`:
        -   `ConfigFileBuilder.js` is the VR configuration file builder.
    - Directory `trial_file`:
        -   `TrialFileHome.js` is the home page for generating trial files.
        -   `TrialFileManualInputHome.js` is the home page for generating trial files with manual input.
            -   `SceneBuilder.js` is the page where user creates a scene.
            -   `TrialFileBuilder.js` is the trial file builder. User selects from available scenes to build trial files.
        -   `CSVTrialFileConverter.js` is the page where user converts a CSV file to a JSON trial file.
    - Directory `form_settings`:
        -   `FormSettingsPage.js` is the page where user edits the VR Configuration/Object form settings.
        -   `FormSettingEditor.js` allows users to import new VR Configuration/Object form settings. A sub-component of `FormSettingsPage`.
        -   `ObjectTypesEditor.js` allows users to add/delete object types. A sub-component of `FormSettingsPage`.
    -   Directory `dynamic_form` contains `DynamicForm`, a component that reads in a form setting and displays the form accordingly.
        -   `DynamicForm.js` is the `DynamicForm` component.
        -   `DynamicFormEntry.js` is a sub-component of `DynamicForm`.
    -   Directory `util` contains util functions used in other files.
        -   `formSettingJSONParser.js` for parsing newly imported form setting files in JSON format.
        -   `trialFileCSVParser.js` for parsing trial files in CSV format.

        -   When the application runs for the first time, `form_config.db` and `scenes.db` are set up in a directory named `db` in user's app data folder:
            -   For Windows, this app data folder is usually at `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\configurable-vr-file-generator`.
            -   For Mac, this is usually `~/Library/Application Support/configurable-vr-file-generator`.
    
    -   The `xxx.css` files are CSS styles defined for the components in `xxx.js` files. For instance, `Home.css` contains styles used in the `Home.js` component. `Home.js` needs to import `Home.css` via `import "./Home.css"` to use the styles.
